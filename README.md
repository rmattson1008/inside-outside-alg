# Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFG
An implementation of the canonical algorithm (cite) using numpy for rapid calculation.



TODO 
- Management
    - make package somewhere
        - requirements.txt or something
    - should be much better documentation.... hmm docstrings, typing
    - parameter passing is messy and sometimes unnecesary. 
    - a couple big functions could be split smaller
- Additions
    - show parse
    - clarify likelihood in EM
    - decide how "final" to make code for it.
    - maybe handle pcfg bad input
